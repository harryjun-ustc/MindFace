# MosRep in MindSpore

## Introduction
MindSpore is a new generation of full-scenario AI computing framework launched by Huawei in August 2019 and released On March 28, 2020.

We propose a mosaic representation learning framework (MosRep), consisting of a new data augmentation strategy that enriches the backgrounds of each small crop and improves the quality of visual representations.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the performance far greater than the multi-crop strategy on a series of downstream tasks, e.g., +7.4% and +4.9% than the multi-crop strategy on ImageNet-1K with 1% label and 10% label, respectively.
