# Introduction
MindSpore is a new generation of full-scenario AI computing framework launched by Huawei in August 2019 and released On March 28, 2020.

SharpDRO can deal with the most challenging corrupted distributions and achieve improved generalization results compared to well-known baseline methods which is accepted by CVPR 2023.

This repository is the mindspore implementation of SharpDRO and has achieved great performance.

# Performence in the datasets that contain severe noise

For each problem setting, we construct corrupted dataset using CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet30 . Specifically, we perturb the image data with severity level varies from 1 to 5 by using two types of corruption: “Gaussian Noise” and “JPEG Compression”. Moreover, the clean data are considered as having a corruption severity of 0. For each corrupted distribution, we sample them with different probabilities by following Poisson distribution P(3; λ = 1), the sample probabilities are  0.061. Then, we test the robust performance on each data distribution.
